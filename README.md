Manpower Planning
A manufacturing company is modernizing its production process. As such, the company is
undergoing a number of changes that will affect its manpower requirements over the next few
years. This is causing unrest with the labor union.

Owing to the installation of new high-tech machinery, the company is pushing towards obtaining
fewer unskilled workers but more semi-skilled and skilled workers. In addition, forecasts
indicate that a downturn in business is expected in the next year that will reduce the need for
workers in all three categories. 


The company wishes to decide its policy with regard to the following requirements over the next
three years:
1. Recruitment
2. Retraining
3. Redundancy
4. Short term working

The goal is to develop a fair, economical, balanced, and practical solution that will help the
company move from its current workforce to the new projected workforce level.
